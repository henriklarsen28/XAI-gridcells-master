    Plays the game using keyboard inputs.

    This function initializes the game environment, displays the map, and allows the user to control the agent using keyboard inputs.
    The user can press the 'q' key to quit the game, 'w' key to move the agent forward, 'a' key to turn the agent left, and 'd' key to turn the agent right.
    The function continuously checks for keyboard events and performs the corresponding action based on the key pressed.
    The legal actions are updated after each action is performed.
